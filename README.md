# Baseball-with-Iron-Man

Developed a baseball game in Unity, integrated it with Myo armband and Oculus Rift.

Assets modeled in 3DS Max and scripts written both in C# and Javascript. The game puts you in a virtual baseball stadium, lively with sound effects, you see Iron Man ready to pitch you a ball. 

Balls are pitched with different velocities and with slight variation in directions. The aim is to hit as many balls as possible in a certain time which can be set in the beginning of the game. Using a myo arm band, the game is able to get input the movement on your arm in realtime to accurately hit the ball.
